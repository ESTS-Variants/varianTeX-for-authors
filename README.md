# varianTeX for authors

varianTeX for authors is a slimmed down version of the [varianTeX](https://github.com/WoutDLN/varianTeX) LaTeX template, specifically tailored to authors who wish to submit a contribution to [Variants](https://journals.openedition.org/variants/).

## About varianTeX

[varianTeX](https://github.com/WoutDLN/varianTeX) is a reusable LaTeX Template for journals in the Humanities. It was originally developed for [Variants](https://journals.openedition.org/variants/) (the journal of the [European Society for Textual Scholarship](https://textualscholarship.eu/)) by [Wout Dillen](https://github.com/WoutDLN).

Although the template and its design choices are documented in the code itself (in the form of comments), we have also provided a [documentation wiki](https://github.com/ESTS-Variants/varianTeX-for-authors/wiki) with more user-friendly instructions on how to use it.

## About the author

Wout currently works as a Senior Lecturer in Library and Information Science at the [University of Borås](https://www.hb.se/), Sweden.
